Static_Seisa depending on alpha: Running for infinite time. The expanded list contains "Milestone" and "Imani Coppola" in alternate iterations. All other entities are same.
Situation for infinite loop:
current: a b c d e
candidate: a f c e d
current: a b c d f
candidate: d c f e d
again current: a b c d e

Static Seisa tries to replace only the last one over iterations. Is it worth doing?

For lower alpha value both Seisa: results depends on the coherence( other entities) a lot resulting semantic drift and poor result.

Dynamic Seisa: completely replaces the currently expanded entity set. That can cause more semantic drift and poor result depending on alpha.

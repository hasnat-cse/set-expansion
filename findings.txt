SEISA:
+ Don't need to fixed output size. It will choose the best.

- For some query and dataset, the choosen threshold can be wrong. If the threshold too large, it can cause semantic drift based on the value of alpha. For higher value of alpha the drift will be less and for lower value drift will be more.

- As previously expanded entities are replaced in successive iteration, chances of semantic drift is high.

+ so far, alpha = 0.9 works best for all query

+ optimized version works faster than set expan.

+ Wrong entities can be corrected in successive iterations


Static SEISA:
- Static Threshold: There are around 200 countries in the dataset.
 But the chosen threshold is 91. So, we will get only 91 entities instead of expected 200.

+ Semantic drift can be less than dynamic


Dynamic SEISA:
 + Dynamic Threshold: We will eventually get around 200 countries.

 - Semantic drift can be more than static.


Set Expan:
- Need to choose the expected output size. If it is large, there will be wrong entities. It it is small, we will get only few entities. Runtime also depends on K.

- depends on r. For small value of r, runtime is higher but correctness is better than large value of r. Large value of r can introduce wrong entities.

+ Very less chance of huge semantic drift. Because in each iteration, it only adds new entities without replacing previous ones.

- There is no way to correct some wrong entities in subsequent iterations


*Need to check varying seed size.




** Concept lists are chosen based on easily verifiable ground truths and variation of length of the ground truth set. Ground truths are got from wikipedia list and based on availability in dataset

** Mymensingh Division exists in only one list but that list contains all the results
** Rangpur Division next less popular

** With popular seeds, accuracy is less. With less popular seeds accuracy is good. Both have difficulty finding less popular entity.

** for SEISA, if the concept is well distinguished from all other entities then threshold is reasonable, Otherwise threshold is not reasonable. For example: Country is well separated,
    But, for asian countries, threshold is pretty bad.
** Both works better for seed size greater than  or equal to 3.
